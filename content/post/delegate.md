Replicator Network's validator operator address is `cosmosvaloper1et77usu8q2hargvyusl4qzryev8x8t9wwqkxfs`.

Atoms can be staked on Cosmos Hub by delegating to Replicator Network. 

Using [`gaiacli`](https://hub.cosmos.network/docs/gaiacli.html):
```sh
$ gaiacli tx staking delegate \
cosmosvaloper1et77usu8q2hargvyusl4qzryev8x8t9wwqkxfs 10000uatom \
--from <delegatorKeyName> --gas auto --gas-prices 0.025uatom
